# Behemoth-Bulldozing
Repository for my first solo Unity game project. Started May 2021 and worked on over Summer 2021.

This is a small 2D, top-down multiplayer monster arcade game I am currently working on. The idea is that the player will compete with one other player to destroy as many buildings in a city as possible before time runs out.

The game is not currently in an (enjoyable) playable state.

Check out the Project Documentation folder to see the project's UML, game doc, and more.

Update 9/19/21: I am currently pausing this project as I focus on my studies and work on smaller, more manageable projects at the moment.
Update 2/11/22: Current game playable here: https://keith-lowry.itch.io/behemoth-bulldozing-progress.

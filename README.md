# Behemoth-Bulldozing
Repository for my first solo Unity game project. Started May 2021 and worked on over Summer 2021.

This is a small 2D, top-down multiplayer monster arcade game I am currently working on. The idea is that the player will compete with one other player to destroy as many buildings in a city as possible before time runs out.

Check out the Project Documentation folder to see the project's UML, game doc, and more.

I am currently pausing this project as I focus on my studies and work on smaller, more manageable projects at the moment. - KL 9/19/2021

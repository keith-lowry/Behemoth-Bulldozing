# Behemoth-Bulldozing
Repository for my first solo Unity game project.

This is a small 2D, top-down multiplayer monster arcade game I am currently working on. The idea is that the player will compete with one other player to destroy as many buildings in a city as possible before time runs out.

The game still needs a lot of work but I will update this ReadMe later on with more details. -- KL 6/16/21
